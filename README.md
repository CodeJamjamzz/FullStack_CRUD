## ⚙️ Technologies Used

### 🖥️ Frontend
- **React (TypeScript)** – Component-based UI with type safety
- **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive design
- **DaisyUI** – Beautiful pre-styled UI components built on top of TailwindCSS

### 🛠️ Backend
- **Node.js with Express.js** – Server-side framework to handle API requests and responses

## 📦 Backend Packages and Their Uses

- **nodemon** – Automatically restarts the server when files change (for faster development)
- **dotenv** – Loads environment variables from a `.env` file (to keep sensitive info secure)
- **axios** – Makes HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend (e.g., GET, POST, etc.)
- **cors** – Allows communication between the frontend and backend even if they are on different ports
